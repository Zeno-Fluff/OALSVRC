# OALSVRC: Outside of VRChat AudioLink System–VRChat

OALSVRC is a standalone audio analysis system that captures system audio, breaks it down into bass, mids, highs, amplitude, and waveform, and sends real-time data to VRChat avatars via OSC. It allows avatars to react to any music playing on your device — Spotify, YouTube, games, anything — without needing in-world audio or mic routing.

# Features
- System audio capture via WASAPI Loopback (no mic required)
- Real-time FFT analysis (bass, mids, highs)
- Waveform and amplitude detection
- OSC transmission to VRChat avatars
- Customizable parameter mapping and reaction styles
- GUI for live control, presets, and OSC routing
- In-VR feedback messages for connection status

# The Idea
To give VRChat users full control over avatar reactions to system audio — making AudioLink truly external, customizable, and universal.
